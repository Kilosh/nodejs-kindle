= Generating a dynamic PNG and displaying it on a Kindle E-reader

Small hobby project based on the basic concept from https://github.com/pjimenezmateo/kindle-wallpaper.
I wanted to learn:

* how to hack the kindle e-reader
* training my nodejs skills
* deploying nodejs application to amazon cloud

The nodejs application offers a GET-method to retrieve a "Status" PNG which than can be displayed on the kindle e-Reader.
